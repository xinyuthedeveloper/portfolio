		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>I found my passion for web development after I gradutaed from college. Before starting my journey here at <b>Thinkful</b>, I was trying to get familiar with the concepts of web development tools. This helped me a lot to get ahead on the early stage of this program. I look forward to being able to work with other students and talented web developers out there. I am also interested in hiking and outdoor running besideds web development. Please feel free to contact me if you want to work on a project together or hangout sometimes.</p>
